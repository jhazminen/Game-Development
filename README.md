# Labyrinth-Isolation

A third-person shooter game heavily inspired by the Resident Evil 4 gameplay, complete with aim mode (right click) and no-reload automatic firing

Gameplay:
The gameplay is rather simple, the player starts off with a primary weapon, a M4 gun, and use the various resources in the level to escape
the labyrinth with the character's friends.

Player Character:
The player character is created through the Autodesk Character generator, since rigging and skinning manually in Blenderx64 made the character harder to animate with the free animations provided in unity and it took too much of the valuable time. Since in the original Stealth game, where most of the assets were taken, the game view is in top-down angle and always points to the positive z direction, I had to change the controls to mostly that of a first-person shooter game. The gun rig was taken from one of the other completed games in unity namely, Bootcamp, and I attached it to the character player that I have by creating a new game object and used the shoulder down to the arms transform to create the left and right grips. The animations and sound effects were also taken from some of the unity projects, including the walk animation and the shooting sound effects.
